# Movie-Genre-Prediction-Multi-Label
CSE587 Data Incentive Computing  

Project Description -
The objective of the project is to implement a movie genre prediction model using Apache Spark
The dataset provided here contains information about movies.
train.csv has movie summaries of around 31K movies along with their genres. You will use this to train your predictive analytics model
test.csv has just plot summaries. You will be predicting the genre of these movies
The task of predicting the genre is essentially a multi-label classification problem. A movie can have multiple genres associated with it. Your model should be able to predict all the genre associated with the movie
The mapping of the genre to the string index should be generated in .csv format. For example presence of genre ‘Drama’ is indicated by a ‘1’ in the first position of the prediction string and an absence of this genre is indicated by ‘0 in the first position
