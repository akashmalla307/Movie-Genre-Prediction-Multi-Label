# Movie-Genre-Prediction-Multi-Label
CSE587 Data Incentive Computing  

The objective of the project is to implement a movie genre prediction model using Apache Spark
The task of predicting the genre is essentially a multi-label classification problem. A movie can have multiple genres associated with it. Your model should be able to predict all the genre associated with the movie
Created a term-document matrix from the plots and use these as feature vectors for the machine learning model, whose macro - f1 score was 0.97
To improve the performance of the model,  implemented the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) based feature engineering technique  whose macro-f1 score was 0.98
To improve the performance of the model again, implement the Word2vec feature engineering technique 
whose macro-f1 score was 1.0
So, overall we got the improvement in performance by 0.03
